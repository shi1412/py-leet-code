#------------------ Question ----------------------
# You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  
# Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  
# You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
# The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. 
# Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

#------------------- Note ----------------------
# S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
# The characters in J are distinct.

#------------------- Answer ----------------------
